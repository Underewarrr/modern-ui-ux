## Creating a Fork and PR
### Things you need to know
Our app are an Single Page Aplication, so we can say our `containers` inside `src` are our "`page`". The `components` inside our `src` are the `components`
For example in `container Feature` we render the `component Features`, everything are called in one page `app.js` like i said `spa`

Just clone the repo and change to branch `myname-containersname`

# make sure to install node dependencies
